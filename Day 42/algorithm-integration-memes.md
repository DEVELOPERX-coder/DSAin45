  - Person 1: "Use inverted index for fast lookups!"
  - Person 2: "Implement TF-IDF for better relevance!"
  - Person 3: "Use suffix trees for substring searching!"
  - Person 4 (thrown out window): "Maybe we could just search files one by one with the naive approach?"

## 4. "Algorithm Selection Paradox"
- **Format**: "Sweating Guy Choosing Between Buttons" meme
- **Text**:
  - Button 1: "Use an O(n) algorithm with terrible constant factors"
  - Button 2: "Use an O(n log n) algorithm that's blazing fast in practice"
  - Sweating person: "Software engineer designing a high-performance system"
- **Caption**: "Big O notation is a useful approximation, but real-world performance is what users experience."

## 5. "Debugging Integration Issues"
- **Format**: "Disaster Girl" meme (girl smiling in front of burning house)
- **Text**: "When you finish integrating your 4th algorithm and suddenly none of them work together anymore"
- **Caption**: "Compatibility testing? We'll do that in production."

## 6. "Algorithm Integration Knowledge"
- **Format**: "Expanding Brain" meme (4 panels)
- **Text**:
  - Level 1 (small brain): "Using sort() from the standard library"
  - Level 2 (medium brain): "Implementing your own quicksort"
  - Level 3 (glowing brain): "Using different sorting algorithms based on input characteristics"
  - Level 4 (cosmic brain): "Creating a custom hybrid sort that switches between algorithms mid-execution based on the data pattern"
- **Caption**: "The evolution of a systems engineer."

## 7. "The Full Stack Integration"
- **Format**: "Pointing Spider-Man" meme
- **Text**: 
  - Spider-Man 1: "Developers using complex algorithm integrations"
  - Spider-Man 2: "Users who just want the app to work"
- **Caption**: "The beauty of abstraction is that users have no idea how much complexity you just hid from them."

## 8. "The Specialized Algorithm Trap"
- **Format**: "They're the Same Picture" (Pam from The Office)
- **Text**: 
  - Top image: "Super optimized, cutting-edge, specialized algorithm that perfectly solves a very specific problem"
  - Bottom image: "Simple general-purpose algorithm that works well enough for 99% of real-world cases"
- **Caption**: "Don't over-engineer: sometimes the boring solution is the right solution."

## 9. "Cache Consistency Issues"
- **Format**: "Confused Jackie Chan" meme
- **Text**: "When your distributed cache with consistent hashing suddenly becomes inconsistent for no apparent reason"
- **Caption**: "Turns out someone accidentally deployed a different hash function to the new nodes. Oops."

## 10. "Integration Testing"
- **Format**: "Car Tape Fix" meme (car held together with duct tape)
- **Text**: "Our algorithm integration testing strategy"
- **Caption**: "It works in production so nobody touch anything!"

## 11. "The Algorithm Specialist"
- **Format**: "Is This a Pigeon?" meme
- **Text**: 
  - Person: "Algorithm specialist who only knows sorting algorithms"
  - Butterfly: "Complex system requiring distributed processing, caching, and network optimization"
  - Caption label: "Is this just a sorting problem?"
- **Caption**: "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

## 12. "The Real Complexity"
- **Format**: "Drake Hotline Bling" meme (disapproving/approving)
- **Text**:
  - Top panel (disapproving): "O(n) algorithm time complexity"
  - Bottom panel (approving): "O(1) developer comprehension complexity"
- **Caption**: "Maintainability matters more than you think. A complex algorithm with amazing performance is useless if nobody can maintain it."
