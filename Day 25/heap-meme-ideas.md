- "How I see it": Nice, organized tree diagram of a heap
- "How it's stored": [90, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20]
- Caption: "2*i+1 and 2*i+2 are the real MVPs"

## Meme Idea 10: "The Confusion"
**Format**: Confused Math Lady meme
**Content**:
- Text overlay: "When you realize a Binary Heap is a complete binary tree but a Binary Heap is not the same as a Binary Search Tree and there's no left-right ordering between nodes on the same level"
