## 3. "Distracted Boyfriend" Meme
- **Format**: Man looking at another woman while his girlfriend looks shocked
- **Text**:
  - Boyfriend (labeled "Me"): Looking at "Bottom-up DP with elegant iteration"
  - Other woman (labeled "Bottom-up DP with elegant iteration"): Looking seductive
  - Girlfriend (labeled "Recursive solutions that I understand"): Looking shocked
- **Caption**: "After hours of struggling with recursive backtracking, the elegant pattern of bottom-up DP finally reveals itself."
- **Educational Value**: Illustrates the transition many programmers make from recursive thinking to the more efficient bottom-up approach, which can be intimidating at first but elegant once understood.

## 4. "Drake Approving/Disapproving" Meme
- **Format**: Drake refusing in top panel, approving in bottom panel
- **Text**:
  - Top panel (disapproving): "Recursively finding edit distance with 3^(m+n) operations"
  - Bottom panel (approving): "Using a 2D table to compute edit distance in O(m·n) time"
- **Caption**: "Why compute the same subproblems exponentially many times when you can just look them up?"
- **Educational Value**: Emphasizes how DP drastically reduces time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations in problems like Edit Distance.

## 5. "Wait, It's All..." Meme
- **Format**: Astronaut pointing gun at another astronaut looking at Earth
- **Text**:
  - First astronaut: "Wait, all these DP problems are just variations of Longest Common Subsequence?"
  - Second astronaut with gun: "Always has been."
- **Caption**: "Once you see the pattern, you can't unsee it. So many string DP problems are connected to LCS."
- **Educational Value**: Highlights how understanding one core DP problem like LCS helps solve many related problems like shortest common supersequence, edit distance, etc.

## 6. "Woman Yelling at Cat" Meme
- **Format**: Woman yelling at confused cat at dinner table
- **Text**:
  - Woman (labeled "My professor"): "YOU NEED TO DEFINE THE RECURRENCE RELATION AND IDENTIFY THE BASE CASES BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE!"
  - Cat (labeled "Me"): Looking confused while drawing random 2D arrays
- **Caption**: "The most important step in solving any DP problem is properly defining what each state represents and how states relate to each other. The code comes later."
- **Educational Value**: Emphasizes the importance of carefully defining the DP state and recurrence relation before implementation, which is often the hardest part of DP.

## 7. "Roll Safe" Meme
- **Format**: Man tapping his temple with a clever expression
- **Text**: "Can't have space complexity issues if you use tabulation with a 1D array"
- **Caption**: "Space optimization in DP: when you only need values from the previous row, you don't need to store the entire matrix."
- **Educational Value**: Teaches the common space optimization technique where you reduce the memory usage by only keeping track of the necessary previous states.

## 8. "Gru's Plan" Meme
- **Format**: Four-panel Gru explaining his plan, then realizing something
- **Text**:
  - Panel 1: "Identify overlapping subproblems in the matrix chain multiplication problem"
  - Panel 2: "Create a 2D table for optimal split points"
  - Panel 3: "Get O(n³) complexity instead of exponential"
  - Panel 4 (surprised look): "Get O(n³) complexity instead of exponential"
- **Caption**: "When you realize your DP solution still has cubic complexity, but it's actually a massive improvement over the exponential brute force approach."
- **Educational Value**: Shows that even polynomial time complexities like O(n³) are huge improvements over exponential algorithms for problems like Matrix Chain Multiplication.

## 9. "Is This a Pigeon?" Meme
- **Format**: Anime character pointing at a butterfly asking "Is this a pigeon?"
- **Text**:
  - Character (labeled "New programmers"): Asking
  - Butterfly (labeled "Any problem involving optimization"): Being pointed at
  - Caption in meme: "Is this a greedy algorithm problem?"
- **Caption**: "Learning when to use DP versus greedy is one of the hardest parts of algorithm design. When in doubt, check if the problem has optimal substructure without greedy choice property."
- **Educational Value**: Highlights a common confusion between greedy algorithms and dynamic programming, teaching when each should be applied.

## 10. "Surprised Pikachu" Meme
- **Format**: Pikachu with shocked expression
- **Text**:
  - Top: "When you implement the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm without memoization"
  - Bottom: "And it times out on inputs of length 20"
- **Caption**: "Exponential complexity hits different when you're waiting for your code to finish running."
- **Educational Value**: Illustrates the practical impact of using DP to avoid exponential time complexity, which becomes noticeable even for relatively small inputs.

## 11. "Galaxy Brain" Meme
- **Format**: Increasingly glowing brain images (4 panels)
- **Text**:
  - First panel: "Using recursion for Edit Distance"
  - Second panel: "Using memoization to solve Edit Distance"
  - Third panel: "Using tabulation with a 2D array for Edit Distance"

- **Educational Value**: Shows the evolution of understanding in DP, from implementation details to recognizing the deep connections between different DP problems.

## 12. "This is Fine" Dog Meme
- **Format**: Dog sitting in burning room saying "This is fine"
