## Neon Color Scheme for All Memes
- Background: Dark (#121212)
- Text highlights and borders: 
  - Cyan (#00FFFF) for tree structure elements
  - Pink (#FF00FF) for traversal algorithms
  - Yellow (#FFFF00) for operations and properties
  - Green (#00FF00) for tree types and classifications
- Use gradient effects between these colors for visual appeal
- Keep clean, non-overlapping layout with text clearly visible against dark background
