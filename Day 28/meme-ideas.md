## Meme Idea 8: "The Height-Balanced Reality Check"
**Format**: "How it started vs How it's going" meme
**Content**:
- How it started: Perfect balanced tree diagram (labeled: "Your whiteboard solution")
- How it's going: Completely unbalanced tree (labeled: "Your solution with real-world data")
- Caption: "POV: You forgot to implement the rotation logic in your AVL tree"

## Meme Idea 9: "The Path Sum Return Value"
**Format**: Confused math lady meme
**Content**:
- "When your path sum function returns true but you need the actual path"

## Meme Idea 10: "The LCA Edge Cases"
**Format**: Car drifting to an exit meme
**Content**:
- Car labeled "Me solving LCA"
- Straight road: "Normal binary tree cases"
- Exit ramp: "Edge cases: - Node is its own ancestor - Nodes don't exist in tree - Tree is empty"
- Caption: "The moment when you realize your elegant 3-line solution doesn't handle all cases"

## Meme Idea 11: "The AVL Tree Rotations"

## Meme Idea 13: "The Tree Height Calculation Methods"
**Format**: Pointing Spider-Man meme with multiple Spider-Men
**Content**:
- Spider-Men labeled: "1 + max(left, right)", "Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1", "height = left > right ? left + 1 : right + 1", "return left > right ? left + 1 : right + 1"
