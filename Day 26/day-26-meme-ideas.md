## Meme Idea 2: "The Heap Sort Reliability"
**Format**: Car salesman meme
**Content**:
- Salesman slapping the roof of Heap Sort
- Salesman: "This bad boy can fit so much consistent O(n log n) performance in it"
- Small text on car: "No worst-case degradation to O(n²) like Quick Sort"
- Caption: "When you need reliability over raw speed"

## Meme Idea 3: "The Two Heaps Pattern"
**Format**: Perfectly balanced Thanos meme
**Content**:
- "The median finder after keeping max heap and min heap balanced"

## Meme Idea 6: "The Heap Applications"
**Format**: Drake preference meme
**Content**:
- Drake disapproving: "Just using heaps for sorting"
- Drake approving: "Using heaps for median finding, priority management, and getting top-K elements"
- Caption: "Heap applications > Heap Sort"

## Meme Idea 7: "The O(n) Build Heap Realization"
**Format**: Mind blown / expanding brain meme
**Content**:
- Normal brain: "Building a heap is O(n log n)"
- Glowing brain: "Actually it's O(n) because most nodes are near the bottom"
- Galaxy brain: "That's why heap sort has a tight O(n log n) bound"
- Caption: "When you finally understand why building a heap is linear time"

## Meme Idea 8: "The K Closest Points"
**Format**: Distance measuring meme
**Content**:
- Points scattered on a 2D plane with origin marked
- MaxHeap with a measuring tape: "I only care about the K closest"
- Caption: "Max heap measuring distances and kicking out the furthest points"

## Meme Idea 9: "The Merge K Sorted Lists Problem"
**Format**: Multi-track drifting meme
**Content**:
- Car drifting across multiple tracks
- Tracks labeled: "List 1", "List 2", "List 3", etc.
- Driver: "Min Heap"
- Caption: "When you need to merge K sorted lists with O(N log K) efficiency"

## Meme Idea 10: "The Priority Queue Restaurant"
**Format**: Restaurant/chef meme
**Content**:
- Chef (labeled "Heap"): "I don't care when you placed your order, only your priority level matters"
- VIP customer: "But I just arrived!"
- Regular customer who arrived earlier: "I've been waiting for hours!"
- Caption: "How a priority queue processes elements: priority > insertion order"

## Meme Idea 11: "The Median Finding"
**Format**: Perfectly balanced scale meme
**Content**:
- Scale with max heap on left, min heap on right
- Person carefully adding a weight (new number)
- Text: "Add to max heap if smaller than median, min heap if larger"
- Caption: "Finding the median in a data stream: Keep the balance, know the middle"

## Meme Idea 12: "The Heap Sort Memory Efficiency"
**Format**: Memory management / RAM usage meme
**Content**:
- Merge Sort: *sweating while using extra O(n) memory*
- Heap Sort: "I only need O(1) extra space"
- Quick Sort: "Same, but I might degrade to O(n²) in worst case"
- Caption: "When memory is a concern, Heap Sort has your back"

These memes combine humor with educational value about heap sort and its applications. Each one reinforces key concepts while making them memorable through familiar meme formats that students and professionals would recognize and appreciate.
