# üöÄ DAY 4: Strings in C++ - Arrays With Character(s) #DSAin45

Welcome to Day 4 of our journey! Yesterday we explored arrays - the foundation of data structures. Today, we're tackling strings, which are fundamentally arrays with personality disorders.

_Strings are just arrays that decided they needed therapy._

## üßµ What Exactly ARE Strings?

At their core, strings are sequences of characters. But in C++, there are two main ways to represent them:

### 1. C-style Strings (char arrays)

These are the OG strings - null-terminated character arrays:

```cpp
char greeting[] = "Hello"; // Compiler adds null terminator '\0'
```

In memory, this looks like:

```
[H][e][l][l][o][\0]
```

That `\0` at the end is the null terminator - it tells functions where the string ends.

_C-style strings are like relationships without clear boundaries - you never know exactly when they'll end until you hit that null terminator._

### 2. C++ std::string

The modern, civilized way to handle strings:

```cpp
std::string greeting = "Hello";
```

Under the hood, std::string is a class that manages:

- A dynamically allocated character array
- Size tracking
- Memory management
- Various utility methods

_If C-style strings are a manual typewriter, std::string is a modern word processor with spell-check, auto-save, and therapy built in._

## üåü Why std::string > C-style Strings

1. **No Buffer Overflow**: std::string grows automatically
2. **Bounds Checking**: Access elements safely with .at()
3. **Memory Management**: No memory leaks
4. **Rich API**: Tons of built-in methods
5. **Interoperability**: Works with modern C++ features

_Using C-style strings in modern C++ is like bringing a horse to a Formula 1 race. It'll get you there, but you'll be wondering why everyone else finished hours ago._

## üîç String Memory Layout

### C-style String Memory:

- Fixed size determined at declaration
- Contiguous memory
- Relies on null terminator to determine end
- Prone to buffer overflows

### std::string Memory:

- Often uses Small String Optimization (SSO)
- Small strings (usually <15 chars) stored directly in the object
- Larger strings stored in dynamically allocated memory
- Tracks both size and capacity

_Small String Optimization is like keeping a small shopping list in your pocket vs. having to go home to get your big shopping list from the fridge._

## ‚öôÔ∏è Common String Operations & Complexity

| Operation      | C-style          | std::string          | Notes                           |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Create         | O(n)             | O(n)                 | Both copy characters            |
| Length         | O(n)             | O(1)                 | std::string caches length       |
| Concatenate    | O(n+m) manual    | O(n+m) with +        | std::string handles memory      |
| Compare        | O(n) with strcmp | O(n) with ==         | std::string overloads operators |
| Access char    | O(1) with []     | O(1) with [] or at() | at() adds bounds checking       |
| Find substring | O(n\*m) manual   | O(n\*m) with find()  | KMP algorithm can improve this  |
| Insert         | O(n) manual      | O(n) with insert()   | May trigger reallocation        |
| Erase          | O(n) manual      | O(n) with erase()    | Shifts characters               |

_A programmer's evolution: First you love strings, then you hate them, then you understand them, and finally you accept that they'll always be a source of bugs regardless._

## üîÑ String Manipulation Techniques

### 1. String Traversal

Iterating through strings is similar to arrays, with a few twists:

**For C-style strings:**

```cpp
// Topic: Character-by-character traversal
// Code example in separate file
```

**For std::string:**

```cpp
// Topic: Modern traversal with iterators and range-based for loops
// Code example in separate file
```

_Modern C++ string traversal is like experiencing the difference between walking on hot coals versus a nice carpet._

### 2. String Transformation

**Case Conversion:**

```cpp
// Topic: Converting to upper/lower case
// Code example in separate file
```

**Substring Extraction:**

```cpp
// Topic: Getting parts of strings with substr()
// Code example in separate file
```

_Extracting substrings in C is like performing surgery with a butter knife. In C++, it's still surgery, but at least you get proper tools._

### 3. String Searching & Matching

**Find Patterns:**

```cpp
// Topic: Finding substrings and characters
// Code example in separate file
```

**Regular Expressions:**

```cpp
// Topic: Pattern matching with regex
// Code example in separate file
```

_Regular expressions are like quantum physics - you think you understand them until you actually need to use them in the real world._

## üèÜ Advanced String Algorithms

### 1. Palindrome Checking

A palindrome reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "racecar").

**Na√Øve Approach:**

```cpp
// Topic: Simple two-pointer technique
// Code example in separate file
```

**Optimized Approach:**

```cpp
// Topic: Skipping non-alphanumeric characters
// Code example in separate file
```

_Palindromes are the dad jokes of string algorithms - simple, predictable, but still satisfying when you get them right._

### 2. Pattern Matching Algorithms

#### Brute Force (Na√Øve) - O(n\*m)

The simplest but least efficient method:

```cpp
// Topic: Checking each possible position
// Code example in separate file
```

#### Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) - O(n+m)

Uses preprocessed pattern to avoid redundant comparisons:

```cpp
// Topic: Building partial match table
// Code example in separate file
```

_KMP algorithm is like bringing a GPS to a maze - it remembers where you've been so you don't waste time checking the same dead ends._

#### Rabin-Karp - Average O(n+m)

Uses hashing to quickly filter non-matches:

```cpp
// Topic: Rolling hash technique
// Code example in separate file
```

_Rabin-Karp is the bouncer of string algorithms - quickly rejects obvious non-matches while spending time only on promising candidates._

### 3. String Compression

Run-length encoding is a simple compression technique:

```cpp
// Topic: Basic run-length encoding
// Code example in separate file
```

_String compression is the Marie Kondo of algorithms - keeping only what brings joy (or information) and discarding repetition._

## üåç Real-World String Applications

1. **Text Editors** - Every feature from find-and-replace to syntax highlighting uses string algorithms

2. **DNA Sequence Analysis** - Genomic data is processed as strings of A, C, G, T characters

3. **Web Development** - URL parsing, HTML manipulation, and template engines

4. **Database Queries** - SQL queries are strings that need parsing and validation

5. **Compilers/Interpreters** - Lexical analysis treats source code as strings

_Most security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows) are just string handling gone wrong. Never trust user input - it's the "hold my beer" of programming._

## üî• Common String Pitfalls

### 1. Buffer Overflow in C-style Strings

```cpp
// Topic: Not checking bounds before writing
// Code example in separate file
```

_Buffer overflows are like trying to pour a gallon of water into a pint glass - the extra has to go somewhere, and that somewhere is usually critical memory._

### 2. String Efficiency Issues

```cpp
// Topic: Concatenating in loops (bad)
// Code example in separate file
```

_Inefficient string concatenation in a loop is the programming equivalent of taking a taxi one block at a time across the entire city._

### 3. Character Encoding Confusion

```cpp
// Topic: Handling multi-byte characters
// Code example in separate file
```

_Character encoding issues are why developers wake up screaming "UTF-8" in the middle of the night._

## üß† Practice Problem:

Implement a function that reverses words in a string while preserving the spaces between words.

Example:

- Input: "Hello World of C++"
- Output: "olleH dlroW fo ++C"

Can you solve it:

1. In-place for C-style strings?
2. Using only std::string methods?
3. Without using any standard library functions?
