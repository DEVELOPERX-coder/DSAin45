- **Caption**: "They're all just trying to distribute traffic evenly."

## 9. "The Bloom Filter Discovery"
- **Format**: "Brain Explosion" (mind blown) meme
- **Text**: "When you realize Bloom filters can save you millions of database lookups with just a tiny bit of memory and some hash functions"
- **Caption**: "Probabilistic data structures are basically magic with math."

## 10. "System Design Interview Prep"
- **Format**: "Two Buttons" meme (sweating person choosing)
- **Text**:
  - Button 1: "Study all the theoretical concepts deeply"
  - Button 2: "Just memorize the common patterns for FAANG interviews"
  - Sweating person: "System design interview in 2 days"
- **Caption**: "The eternal struggle between learning for knowledge vs. learning for interviews."

## 11. "When Requirements Change"
- **Format**: "Confused Jackie Chan" meme
