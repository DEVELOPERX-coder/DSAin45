# üöÄ DAY 3: Arrays - The OGs of Data Structures #DSAin45

Welcome to Day 3 of our journey! Yesterday we learned why some algorithms make your CPU contemplate early retirement. Today, we're diving into arrays - the foundation upon which virtually all other data structures are built.

_Arrays are like that simple tool in your kitchen that you use every day but never appreciate until it breaks._

## üß† What Exactly IS An Array?

An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations, each identified by an index (or position). Think of it as reserved seats in a theater - each seat is numbered sequentially, and the theater manager knows exactly where each seat is located without having to search.

_Arrays are the reason programmers start counting from 0, and the source of countless "off-by-one" therapy sessions._

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Memory Actually Works (The Stuff They Gloss Over)

When you declare an array, what actually happens?

```cpp
int myArray[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```

Your computer:

1. Allocates 5 contiguous blocks of memory (each block is 4 bytes for an int)
2. Stores the starting address (let's say 0x1000)
3. Assigns values to each memory location

So in memory:

- 0x1000: 10
- 0x1004: 20
- 0x1008: 30
- 0x100C: 40
- 0x1010: 50

When you access `myArray[2]`, the computer:

1. Takes the base address (0x1000)
2. Adds `index * sizeof(int)` = 2 \* 4 = 8 bytes
3. Fetches the value at address 0x1008, which is 30

This is why array access is O(1) - the calculation to find any element takes the same time regardless of array size or which element you're accessing.

_The most impressive magic trick in computing isn't AI - it's that we can access the billionth element of an array in the same time as the first._

## üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Deep Dive: Static vs Dynamic Arrays

### Static Arrays (Traditional C-style)

```cpp
int staticArray[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

**Pros:**

- Allocated on stack (faster)
- Memory layout is guaranteed contiguous
- Zero overhead

**Cons:**

- Fixed size determined at compile time
- Can't be resized
- Array size must be known at compile time

_Static arrays are like buying shoes for a child - perfect today, painfully small tomorrow._

### Dynamic Arrays (C++ std::vector)

```cpp
std::vector<int> dynamicArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
dynamicArray.push_back(6); // Grows automatically!
```

**Pros:**

- Can grow or shrink at runtime
- Manages memory automatically
- Rich set of member functions

**Cons:**

- Slightly more overhead
- Resizing can be costly (when capacity is reached)
- Allocated on heap (slightly slower)

_Dynamic arrays are like those expandable suitcases - more expensive upfront, but they save you from panic attacks when you buy too many souvenirs._

### How Vector Resizing Works

The genius of `std::vector` is its resizing strategy:

1. Vector has `size` (current elements) and `capacity` (allocated memory)
2. When `size == capacity` and you add an element:
   - Vector allocates new, larger memory block (typically 1.5x or 2x)
   - Copies all elements to new location
   - Deallocates old memory
   - Adds new element

This gives "amortized" O(1) insertion at the end. It means while some insertions might cost O(n), they're rare enough that the average remains O(1).

_A vector resizing itself is like moving to a bigger apartment: expensive and painful in the moment, but you only do it occasionally._

## üîÑ Common Array Operations & Their Complexity

| Operation                         | Static Array | Dynamic Array (std::vector) | Notes                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Access by index                   | O(1)         | O(1)                        | Direct memory calculation |
| Insert/delete at end              | N/A          | Amortized O(1)              | May trigger resize        |
| Insert/delete at beginning/middle | N/A          | O(n)                        | Need to shift elements    |
| Search (unsorted)                 | O(n)         | O(n)                        | Linear scan required      |
| Search (sorted)                   | O(log n)     | O(log n)                    | Can use binary search     |
| Get size                          | O(1)         | O(1)                        | Stored as a property      |

_In an array, adding something to the end is trivial, but adding to the beginning means waking up every element and telling them to move over - like being the late person in a movie theater row._

## üèóÔ∏è Multidimensional Arrays

### 2D Arrays (Matrices)

```cpp
// Static 2D array
int matrix[3][4] = {
    {1, 2, 3, 4},
    {5, 6, 7, 8},
    {9, 10, 11, 12}
};

// Dynamic 2D array
vector<vector<int>> dynamicMatrix = {
    {1, 2, 3, 4},
    {5, 6, 7, 8},
    {9, 10, 11, 12}
};
```

**Memory Layout:**

- Static 2D arrays are actually 1D under the hood
- `matrix[i][j]` is at position `(i * COLS + j)`
- Dynamic 2D vectors can have "jagged" rows (different lengths)

_The plot twist of programming: 2D arrays don't really exist. They're just 1D arrays wearing a clever disguise and doing math tricks._

## üîç Array Techniques You'll See Everywhere

### 1. Two-Pointer Technique

```cpp
// Find a pair that sums to target in sorted array
bool findPair(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = arr.size() - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        int sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
        if (sum == target) return true;
        else if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return false;
}
```

_The two-pointer technique is like having two people search a library from opposite ends - much faster than one person checking every single book._

### 2. Sliding Window

```cpp
// Find maximum sum subarray of size k
int maxSumSubarray(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    int maxSum = 0;
    int windowSum = 0;

    // Compute sum of first window
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        windowSum += arr[i];
    }
    maxSum = windowSum;

    // Slide window and update maxSum
    for (int i = k; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        windowSum = windowSum - arr[i-k] + arr[i];
        maxSum = max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```

_The sliding window technique is like being at a buffet with a fixed-size plate - as you add new items, you have to remove others, constantly optimizing for the best combination._

### 3. Prefix Sums

```cpp
// Precompute sums for efficient range queries
vector<int> buildPrefixSum(vector<int>& arr) {
    vector<int> prefix(arr.size());
    prefix[0] = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i];
    }
    return prefix;
}

// Get sum of range [left, right] in O(1)
int rangeSum(vector<int>& prefix, int left, int right) {
    if (left == 0) return prefix[right];
    return prefix[right] - prefix[left-1];
}
```

_Prefix sums are like those progressive tax calculation tables - do the hard work once, then look up answers instantly later._

## üö® Common Array Pitfalls

### 1. Off-by-One Errors

```cpp
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
// This is bad: arr[5] doesn't exist!
int oops = arr[5];
```

_Off-by-one errors are the "Did I turn off the stove?" of programming - you'll wake up in a cold sweat thinking about them._

### 2. Neglecting Bounds Checking

```cpp
// Always check bounds in production code
if (index >= 0 && index < arr.size()) {
    // Safe to access arr[index]
}
```

_Not checking array bounds is like assuming everyone drives within their lanes - a theoretically pleasant idea that's catastrophically wrong in practice._

### 3. Forgetting That Arrays Are Zero-Indexed

_The two hardest problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors._

## üíº Real-World Applications

Arrays aren't just interview fodder - they're everywhere:

1. **Image Processing** - Each pixel in a 2D array
2. **Spreadsheets** - Cells in a grid
3. **Game Boards** - Chess, tic-tac-toe, etc.
4. **Sensor Data** - Time-series measurements
5. **Database Indices** - B-trees are array-based

_Arrays are the digital equivalent of atoms - they make up practically everything, yet we rarely think about them individually._

## üß© Practice Problem:

Implement a function that rotates an array of n elements to the right by k steps. For example, with `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` and `k = 3`, the result would be `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`.

Can you solve it:

1. With O(n) time and O(1) space?
2. In multiple ways?
