## Meme Idea 4: "The Sorting Job Interview"

**Format**: Job interview meme

- **Interviewer**: "We need someone to sort a nearly-sorted array of 10 elements. What's your approach?"
- **Bubble Sort**: "I'll check every element with its neighbor and swap if needed."
- **Selection Sort**: "I'll find the minimum element and put it at the beginning, then repeat."
- **Insertion Sort**: "I'll build a sorted array one element at a time."
- **Quick Sort (barging in)**: "I'll partition the array and..."
- **Interviewer**: "That's overkill for 10 elements. Insertion Sort, you're hired!"
- **Caption**: "When being O(n²) actually gets you the job"

## Meme Idea 5: "Sorting Explained by Pizza"

**Format**: Explaining concepts with pizza meme

## Meme Idea 8: "Sorting Algorithm Excuses"

**Format**: Student excuses meme

- **Bubble Sort**: "I'm not slow, I'm thorough."
- **Selection Sort**: "I use the minimum number of swaps!"
- **Insertion Sort**: "I'm actually O(n) on almost sorted data!"
- **Teacher (Merge Sort)**: "You're all still O(n²) in the worst case."
- **Caption**: "No matter how you spin it, n² is still n²"

## Meme Idea 9: "The Sorting Personality Test"

**Format**: "Which sorting algorithm are you?" personality quiz results

- **You got: Bubble Sort!** You're straightforward and traditional. You might not be the fastest, but you're reliable and everyone understands you.
- **You got: Selection Sort!** You're methodical and minimize your actions. You always find the best option before making a move.
- **You got: Insertion Sort!** You're adaptive and work best with partially organized situations. You excel at handling one thing at a time.
- **Caption**: "Tag yourself: I'm definitely Insertion Sort - works great until things get too chaotic"

## Meme Idea 10: "The Sorting Algorithm Gym"

**Format**: Different exercises at a gym

- **Bubble Sort**: Slowly walking up and down the stairs repeatedly
