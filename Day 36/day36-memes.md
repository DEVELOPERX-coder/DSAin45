- **Caption**: "When your elegant recursive solution encounters the harsh reality of exponential time complexity. The system crashes while mathematically, it's doing exactly what you told it to do."
- **Educational Value**: Highlights the practical limitations of naive recursive solutions for DP problems.

## 8. "Change My Mind" Meme
- **Format**: Steven Crowder sitting at table with "Change My Mind" sign
- **Text**:
  - Sign: "Dynamic Programming is just recursion with a good memory. Change my mind."
- **Caption**: "The fundamental insight of DP in one sentence. Once you understand this, the rest is just implementation details."
- **Educational Value**: Succinctly captures the core concept of dynamic programming in a memorable way.

## 9. "Galaxy Brain" Meme

- **Text**:
  - Top: "Recursively calculate the 40th Fibonacci number with no memoization"
  - Bottom: "(computer fans start screaming)"
- **Caption**: "When exponential time complexity hits you in real life. Theoretical O-notation suddenly becomes very tangible."
- **Educational Value**: Illustrates the dramatic real-world impact of inefficient algorithms on hardware performance.
