- **Text**:
  - Sign: "Network flow is just fancy BFS with extra steps. Change my mind."
- **Caption**: "While Ford-Fulkerson with Edmonds-Karp does use BFS to find augmenting paths, the residual graph concept and flow augmentation make it a fundamentally different algorithm."

## 8. "Pointing Spider-Man" Meme
- **Format**: Two Spider-Men pointing at each other
- **Text**:
  - Spider-Man 1: "Minimum Cut"
