# Day 35: Weekly Challenge & Graph Problems #DSAin45

## Introduction

Welcome to Day 35 of our #DSAin45 journey! Yesterday, we explored advanced graph algorithms including strongly connected components, articulation points, bridges, and an introduction to flow networks. Today, we'll put that knowledge to work by tackling some challenging graph problems and exploring powerful optimization techniques. Graph algorithms are the backbone of countless real-world applications—from navigation systems to social networks, from compiler optimizations to epidemic modeling. Let's dive deep into some fascinating graph problems and their elegant solutions!

## Core Concepts: Classic Graph Problems

### Network Flow Problems

Network flow is a powerful framework for solving a wide class of graph problems. In a flow network, we have:

- A directed graph with edges having capacity constraints
- A source vertex (s) and a sink vertex (t)
- Flow along each edge, respecting capacity and conservation constraints

#### The Max Flow Problem

The max flow problem asks: what's the maximum amount of flow we can push from source to sink?

**Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm**:

1. Initialize flow on all edges to 0
2. While there exists an augmenting path from s to t:
   - Find an augmenting path (using DFS or BFS)
   - Compute the bottleneck capacity (minimum residual capacity along the path)
   - Augment the flow along the path by the bottleneck capacity
3. Return the total flow

The Ford-Fulkerson method with BFS implementation (Edmonds-Karp algorithm) gives us O(V·E²) time complexity.

#### Residual Graphs

A key concept in flow algorithms is the residual graph:

- For each edge (u,v) with capacity c and flow f, we have:
  - A forward edge (u,v) with residual capacity c-f
  - A backward edge (v,u) with residual capacity f

This allows us to "undo" flow decisions when needed, enabling the algorithm to find the optimal solution.

### Bipartite Matching Problems

A bipartite graph is one whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in the first set to a vertex in the second set.

**Maximum Bipartite Matching Problem**: Find the maximum number of edges with no common vertices.

This can be solved using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm by:

1. Creating a source node connected to all vertices in the first set
2. Creating a sink node connected to all vertices in the second set
3. Setting all edge capacities to 1
4. Finding the maximum flow

#### Hungarian Algorithm

For weighted bipartite matching (the assignment problem), we can use the Hungarian algorithm:

1. Create a cost matrix where rows represent workers, columns represent jobs
2. For each row, subtract the minimum value in that row from all elements in the row
3. For each column, subtract the minimum value in that column from all elements in the column
4. Cover all zeros in the matrix with the minimum number of lines
5. If the number of lines equals n, we have an optimal assignment; otherwise:
   - Find the smallest uncovered element
   - Subtract it from all uncovered elements
   - Add it to elements covered twice
   - Return to step 4

Time complexity: O(n³), where n is the number of vertices in each partition.

### Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The TSP asks for the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

It's NP-hard, so we use approximation or heuristic algorithms for large instances:

#### Dynamic Programming Approach (for smaller instances)

```cpp
// Held-Karp algorithm for TSP
int tsp(vector<vector<int>>& dist) {
    int n = dist.size();
    vector<vector<int>> dp(1<<n, vector<int>(n, INF));

    // Base case: start at vertex 0
    dp[1][0] = 0;

    // Iterate through all subsets of vertices
    for (int mask = 1; mask < (1<<n); mask++) {
        for (int u = 0; u < n; u++) {
            // If u is in the current subset
            if (mask & (1<<u)) {
                for (int v = 0; v < n; v++) {
                    // If v is also in the subset and is different from u
                    if ((mask & (1<<v)) && v != u) {
                        dp[mask][u] = min(dp[mask][u],
                                          dp[mask ^ (1<<u)][v] + dist[v][u]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the shortest path that visits all vertices and ends at 0
    int result = INF;
    for (int u = 1; u < n; u++) {
        result = min(result, dp[(1<<n) - 1][u] + dist[u][0]);
    }
    return result;
}
```

Time complexity: O(2ⁿ · n²), impractical for n > 20.

#### Approximation Algorithms

**Christofides Algorithm**:

1. Construct a minimum spanning tree (MST)
2. Find the vertices with odd degree in the MST
3. Find a minimum-weight perfect matching of these vertices
4. Combine the MST and the matching to form an Eulerian circuit
5. Shortcut the circuit to form a Hamiltonian cycle (the TSP tour)

Guarantees a tour at most 1.5 times the optimal.

### Minimum Spanning Tree with Constraints

Sometimes, we need to find MSTs with additional constraints:

#### Degree-Constrained MST

Problem: Find an MST where each vertex has at most k edges.

This is NP-hard for general k, but algorithms exist for specific values:

For k=2, it's the path problem, solved using dynamic programming.
For large graphs with specific constraints, we can use Lagrangian relaxation or genetic algorithms.

## Visual Explanations of Algorithms

### Max Flow Visualization

Imagine a network of pipes with water flowing from a source to a destination:

1. **Initial Network**:

   ```
   s → A (capacity 10)
     → B (capacity 5)
   A → C (capacity 6)
     → B (capacity 2)
   B → C (capacity 3)
     → t (capacity 8)
   C → t (capacity 10)
   ```

2. **Augmenting Path 1**: s → A → C → t (Min capacity: 6)

   ```
   s → A (flow 6/10)
   A → C (flow 6/6)
   C → t (flow 6/10)
   ```

3. **Augmenting Path 2**: s → B → C → t (Min capacity: 3)

   ```
   s → B (flow 3/5)
   B → C (flow 3/3)
   C → t (flow 9/10)
   ```

4. **Augmenting Path 3**: s → A → B → t (Min capacity: 2)

   ```
   s → A (flow 8/10)
   A → B (flow 2/2)
   B → t (flow 5/8)
   ```

5. **Augmenting Path 4**: s → B → t (Min capacity: 2)

   ```
   s → B (flow 5/5)
   B → t (flow 7/8)
   ```

6. **No more augmenting paths**: Max flow = 16

The visualization would animate the flow incrementing along each path, with the residual graph shown alongside to demonstrate the backward edges.

### Bipartite Matching Visualization

Consider a job assignment problem:

```
Workers: A, B, C
Jobs: 1, 2, 3, 4

A can do jobs 1, 2
B can do jobs 2, 3
C can do jobs 2, 4
```

1. **Convert to flow network**:

   - Add source s connected to A, B, C with capacity 1
   - Add sink t connected from jobs 1, 2, 3, 4 with capacity 1
   - Each worker-job edge has capacity 1

2. **Initial augmenting path**: s → A → 1 → t
3. **Second augmenting path**: s → B → 3 → t
4. **Third augmenting path**: s → C → 4 → t
5. **Maximum matching**: {(A,1), (B,3), (C,4)}

The animation would show each step of the augmenting path algorithm, highlighting the matching edges.

## Time & Space Complexity Analysis

### Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

- **Time Complexity**: O(E · f), where E is the number of edges and f is the maximum flow.
  - This can be bad if capacities are large.
  - Using BFS (Edmonds-Karp): O(V · E²)
  - Using capacity scaling: O(E² · log C), where C is the maximum capacity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for the residual graph.

The mathematical reasoning behind the Edmonds-Karp time bound:

- Each augmentation increases the flow.
- The length of the shortest augmenting path never decreases.
- After at most V·E augmentations, no augmenting path exists.
- Each BFS takes O(E) time.
- Total: O(V · E²).

### Hungarian Algorithm

- **Time Complexity**: O(n³), where n is the number of workers/jobs.
  - The original algorithm by Kuhn was O(n⁴).
  - The improved version by Munkres reduces this to O(n³).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n²) for the cost matrix and matching information.

The cubic time bound comes from:

- At most n iterations of the main loop
- Each iteration requires finding a maximum matching, which takes O(n²) time
- Hence, O(n · n²) = O(n³).

### Held-Karp Algorithm for TSP

- **Time Complexity**: O(2ⁿ · n²)
  - We consider 2ⁿ subsets of vertices.
  - For each subset and each vertex, we check all other vertices: O(n²).
- **Space Complexity**: O(2ⁿ · n) for the DP table.

The exponential time is unavoidable due to the NP-hardness of the problem, explaining why we need approximation algorithms for large instances.

## C++ Implementation

Here's a detailed C++ implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm with the Edmonds-Karp improvement:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <limits>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int INF = numeric_limits<int>::max();

// Ford-Fulkerson algorithm with Edmonds-Karp improvement
int maxFlow(vector<vector<int>>& graph, int source, int sink) {
    int n = graph.size();
    vector<vector<int>> residualGraph = graph;
    vector<int> parent(n, -1);
    int maxFlow = 0;

    // Helper function to find augmenting path using BFS
    auto bfs = [&]() -> bool {
        fill(parent.begin(), parent.end(), -1);
        queue<int> q;
        q.push(source);
        parent[source] = -2; // Mark source as visited

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int u = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (int v = 0; v < n; v++) {
                if (parent[v] == -1 && residualGraph[u][v] > 0) {
                    parent[v] = u;
                    if (v == sink) return true; // Found path to sink
                    q.push(v);
                }
            }
        }
        return false; // No augmenting path found
    };

    // Augment flow while there is an augmenting path
    while (bfs()) {
        // Find minimum residual capacity along the path
        int pathFlow = INF;
        for (int v = sink; v != source; v = parent[v]) {
            int u = parent[v];
            pathFlow = min(pathFlow, residualGraph[u][v]);
        }

        // Update residual capacities
        for (int v = sink; v != source; v = parent[v]) {
            int u = parent[v];
            residualGraph[u][v] -= pathFlow; // Forward edge
            residualGraph[v][u] += pathFlow; // Backward edge
        }

        maxFlow += pathFlow;
    }

    return maxFlow;
}

// Example usage of maxFlow for bipartite matching
int maxBipartiteMatching(vector<vector<bool>>& bpGraph) {
    int n = bpGraph.size();    // Number of applicants
    int m = bpGraph[0].size(); // Number of jobs

    // Create flow graph with source (n+m) and sink (n+m+1)
    int vertices = n + m + 2;
    int source = n + m;
    int sink = n + m + 1;

    vector<vector<int>> graph(vertices, vector<int>(vertices, 0));

    // Add edges from source to all applicants
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        graph[source][i] = 1;
    }

    // Add edges from all jobs to sink
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        graph[n + i][sink] = 1;
    }

    // Add edges from applicants to jobs
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (bpGraph[i][j]) {
                graph[i][n + j] = 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return maxFlow(graph, source, sink);
}
```

## Edge Cases & Optimizations

### Edge Cases in Max Flow

1. **Disconnected Graphs**: If the source and sink are in different connected components, the max flow is zero.

2. **Multi-source/Multi-sink**: Convert to standard max flow by:

   - Adding a super-source with edges to all sources
   - Adding a super-sink with edges from all sinks

3. **Parallel Edges**: Combine them into a single edge with summed capacity.

4. **Vertex Capacities**: Model by splitting each vertex v into vin and vout with an edge from vin to vout with the vertex capacity.

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Push-Relabel Algorithm**:

   - O(V² · E) time complexity, better for dense graphs
   - Works by maintaining a preflow and gradually converting it to a valid flow

2. **Dinic's Algorithm**:

   - O(V² · E) worst-case, but much faster in practice
   - Uses level graphs to find blocking flows

3. **Capacity Scaling**:

   - Start with the highest-capacity edges
   - Gradually include lower-capacity edges
   - Improves convergence for graphs with large capacities

4. **Global Min-Cut**:
   - Compute maximum flow for each possible source-sink pair
   - Take the minimum value as the global min-cut
   - Can be optimized with Stoer-Wagner algorithm (O(V · E + V² log V))

## Real-world Applications

### 1. Transportation Networks

Graph algorithms power modern GPS navigation systems like Google Maps. When finding the quickest route from point A to B:

- Vertices represent intersections
- Edges represent roads with weights (travel time)
- Traffic data dynamically updates edge weights
- Algorithms like A\* (an optimized Dijkstra) find the fastest routes
- Flow algorithms optimize traffic light timing to maximize throughput

Real implementations must handle:

- Real-time traffic updates
- Road closures and detours
- Different modes of transportation
- Time-dependent traversal costs

### 2. Social Network Analysis

Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter use graph algorithms to:

- Recommend friends/connections (via similarity measures in the graph)
- Detect communities (using clustering algorithms)
- Identify influential users (using centrality measures)
- Spread information efficiently (using dominating set algorithms)
- Prevent fake accounts and fraud (using anomaly detection in graph patterns)

For example, Facebook's friend recommendation system uses:

- Common neighbors analysis
- Path-based similarity measures
- Random walk algorithms
- Graph embedding techniques

### 3. Network Security

Cybersecurity applications leverage graph algorithms to:

- Model attack vectors as graphs
- Find critical vulnerabilities (using articulation points)
- Identify minimal security patches (using minimum vertex cover)
- Detect intrusion patterns (using subgraph isomorphism)
- Optimize firewall rules (using flow optimization)

The Cyber Kill Chain model uses directed graphs to track attack progression through systems, helping identify where defenses should be placed.

### 4. Compiler Optimization

Modern compilers use graphs extensively:

- Control flow graphs represent program execution paths
- Data dependency graphs show variable relationships
- Register allocation uses graph coloring
- Dead code elimination uses reachability analysis
- Code optimization uses cycle detection and elimination

LLVM's optimizer uses graph-based intermediate representation to perform over 100 different optimization passes.

### 5. Biological Networks

In computational biology, graphs model:

- Protein interaction networks
- Metabolic pathways
- Gene regulatory networks
- Evolutionary relationships (phylogenetic trees)
- Disease transmission patterns

Researchers use graph algorithms to identify drug targets, understand disease mechanisms, and track epidemic spread.

### The Traveling Salesman's Nightmare

A traveling salesman walks into a bar. The bartender asks, "Why the long face?"

The salesman replies, "I'm trying to find the optimal route to visit all my clients, but it's NP-hard!"

The bartender says, "That's rough. Want an approximation algorithm?"

The salesman sighs, "No thanks, I've already tried genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and ant colony optimization. At this point, I'm just going to visit them in alphabetical order and call it a day."

The bartender nods sympathetically. "That's what we call the Desperate Salesman Problem—it's O(1) but costs you your commission."

### The Network Flow Analogy

Explaining network flow to non-programmers is like describing plumbing:

"Imagine water flowing through a series of pipes from your water main to your shower. Each pipe can only handle so much water (capacity). The maximum flow algorithm finds out how much water can reach your shower at once.

Now imagine your teenager is also trying to do laundry and your partner is running the dishwasher. Suddenly, your shower goes cold! That's because you hit the max flow, and now you need to implement a push-relabel algorithm to negotiate shower times with your family."

## Practice Problems

### Easy: Course Schedule (LeetCode 207)

**Problem**: There are a total of n courses you have to take. Some courses have prerequisites. Determine if you can finish all courses.

**Approach Hint**:

- Model the problem as a directed graph
- Each course is a vertex
- Each prerequisite creates a directed edge
- The problem becomes: "Is there a cycle in the graph?"
- Use DFS or BFS to detect cycles
- If a cycle exists, it's impossible to finish all courses

### Medium: Network Delay Time (LeetCode 743)

**Problem**: Given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n, and a list of directed edges where edges[i] = [source, target, time], return the minimum time it takes for a signal to reach all nodes. If it's impossible, return -1.

**Approach Hint**:

- This is a shortest path problem from a single source
- Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths
- Track the maximum distance among all nodes
- If any node is unreachable, return -1
- Otherwise, return the maximum distance

### Hard: Bus Routes (LeetCode 815)

**Problem**: You are given an array routes representing bus routes where routes[i] is a bus route that the ith bus repeats forever. You start at the bus stop source and want to go to the bus stop target. Return the least number of buses you must take to travel from source to target. Return -1 if it's impossible.

**Approach Hint**:

- Build a graph where vertices are bus routes (not stops)
- Connect two routes if they share at least one stop
- Transform source and target stops to the routes that include them
- Use BFS to find the shortest path from any route containing source to any route containing target
- This is a clever transformation that significantly reduces the graph size
