# 🔍 DAY 11: Hash Tables - Part 1 - The O(1) Lookup Magicians #DSAin45

Hey connections! We've reached Day 11 of our #DSAin45 journey!

Today we're exploring hash tables - possibly the most powerful and widely-used data structure in modern programming. If you've ever used a dictionary, map, or object in any language, you've already been benefiting from hash tables!

## 🤔 Why Hash Tables Matter

Hash tables give us:
- **O(1) average-time lookups** regardless of size
- **Lightning-fast key-value storage**
- **Powerful building blocks** for countless algorithms

They're the secret sauce behind:
- Database indexes
- Web caching systems
- Language dictionaries
- Compilers and interpreters
- Blockchain technology

## 💡 The Magic Formula

```cpp
// The key to O(1) lookups:
size_t index = hash_function(key) % array_size;
```

This simple concept transforms complex lookups into direct array access - it's like having a teleporter for your data!

## 🧠 Handling Collisions

What happens when different keys hash to the same index? We use collision resolution:

1. **Separate Chaining**: Link colliding items in a list
2. **Open Addressing**: Find another spot using a probing sequence
3. **Robin Hood Hashing**: Steal slots from "rich" elements to give to "poor" ones

## 🚀 Challenge Problem

Implement a function that finds the first non-repeating character in a string. Can you do it in O(n) time using a hash table? (Hint: Count occurrences in a single pass!)

## 🔍 Interview Tip

Hash tables are interview favorites! Know your collision resolution strategies and when to use them. Be able to explain load factors and rehashing.

Tomorrow we'll dive deeper into hash table implementations and advanced techniques!
