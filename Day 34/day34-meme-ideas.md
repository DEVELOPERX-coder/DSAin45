## Meme 4: "Bridge Responsibility"
**Format**: Spider-Man Responsibility meme
**Text**:
- Top: "WITH GREAT CONNECTIVITY"
- Bottom: "COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT BE A BRIDGE"
**Caption**: Network engineers know the struggle!

## Meme 5: "Flow Network Confusion"
**Format**: Math Lady / Confused Lady meme
**Text**: 
- "WHEN THE PROFESSOR SAYS THE MAXIMUM FLOW EQUALS THE MINIMUM CUT, BUT YOU'RE STILL LOOKING FOR AN AUGMENTING PATH"
**Caption**: Ford-Fulkerson making us question everything!

## Meme 6: "The Tarjan Truth"
**Format**: Change My Mind meme
**Text**:
- "TARJAN'S ALGORITHM IS JUST KOSARAJU'S ALGORITHM BUT WITH BETTER TIME MANAGEMENT"
**Caption**: Who needs two DFS passes when you can do it in one?

## Meme 7: "The Algorithm Investor"
**Format**: Distracted Boyfriend meme
**Text**:
- Boyfriend: "Graph Algorithms Developer"
- Girlfriend: "Basic DFS and BFS"
- Other Woman: "Advanced Algorithms like SCCs, Articulation Points, and Flow Networks"

**Caption**: Articulation points reveal themselves at the worst times!

## Meme 9: "The Min-Cut Reality"
**Format**: Expectation vs. Reality meme
**Text**:
- Expectation: "Finding min-cut with one calculation"
- Reality: "Running Ford-Fulkerson repeatedly until no augmenting paths remain"
**Caption**: Network flows making us work for it since 1956.

## Meme 10: "DFS Overload"
**Format**: Expanding Brain meme
**Text**:
- Small brain: "Using DFS to traverse a graph"
- Medium brain: "Using DFS to detect cycles"
- Large brain: "Using DFS to find articulation points and bridges"
