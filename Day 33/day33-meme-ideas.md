- Button 1: "Take Data Structures first"
- Button 2: "Take Algorithms first"
- Person sweating: "Computer Science Student"
**Caption**: This is why we need topological sorting in curriculum planning!

## Meme 3: "DAG Life"
**Format**: Drake Approval meme
**Text**:

- Drake approving: "Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)"
**Caption**: The graph theory connoisseur has a clear preference.

## Meme 4: "Real-world Kahn"
**Format**: "Is this a pigeon?" meme
**Text**:
- Person: "Package Manager"
- Butterfly: "Dependency Resolution"
- Caption: "Is this Kahn's algorithm?"
**Caption**: Every npm install is secretly running a topological sort!

## Meme 5: "It's a DAG"
**Format**: Always Has Been / Astronaut meme
**Text**:
- Astronaut 1: "Wait, it's all just sorting based on dependencies?"
- Astronaut 2 with gun: "Always has been"
**Caption**: Build systems, package managers, scheduling algorithms... it's DAGs all the way down!

## Meme 6: "No Cycles Allowed"
**Format**: Confused math lady meme
**Text**: 
- "When you try to run topological sort on a graph with cycles"
**Caption**: Some problems just can't be solved... literally!

## Meme 7: "The Simplifier"
**Format**: Expanding Brain meme
**Text**:
- Small brain: "Solving dependency issues manually"
- Medium brain: "Using a for loop to check dependencies"
- Large brain: "Implementing Kahn's algorithm"
- Cosmic brain: "Just drawing a DAG on paper and following arrows"
**Caption**: Sometimes the simplest solutions are the best!

## Meme 8: "The In-Degree Zero Club"
**Format**: VIP entrance / bouncer meme
**Text**:
- Bouncer: "Kahn's Algorithm"
- VIP entrance sign: "Queue for nodes with in-degree 0 only"
- Person trying to get in: "Node with in-degree 2"
**Caption**: Sorry, you'll have to wait until your dependencies are processed!

## Meme 9: "Time Complexity Reality"
**Format**: Expectation vs. Reality meme
**Text**:
- Expectation: "O(1) topological sort"
- Reality: "O(V+E) and that's the best we can do"
**Caption**: Graph algorithms keeping it real since forever.

## Meme 10: "Stack vs. Queue"
**Format**: Buff Doge vs. Cheems meme
**Text**:
- Buff Doge (DFS): "I use a stack and recursion for topological sort"
- Cheems (BFS/Kahn): "I just use a queue and count in-degrees"
**Caption**: Two approaches, same result, endless debates.

## Meme 11: "The Cycle Detective"
**Format**: Detective looking through magnifying glass
**Text**:
- "POV: You're trying to find why your topological sort keeps failing"
- Small text visible through magnifying glass: "Circular dependency"
**Caption**: It's always the tiny cycle hiding in your massive codebase!

## Meme 12: "Parallel Tasks"
**Format**: Pointing Spider-Man meme
**Text**:
- Spider-Man 1: "I have no dependencies, I can run first!"
- Spider-Man 2: "No, I have no dependencies, I can run first!"
**Caption**: When your topological sort identifies multiple source nodes, parallelism intensifies!
