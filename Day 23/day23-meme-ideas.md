**Caption**: "That moment when you understand the true power of BSTs. #SortingHack"

## 6. "The Algorithm Interview Dilemma"
**Format**: Sweating guy with two buttons meme
- **Button 1**: "Use a balanced BST for O(log n) operations"
- **Button 2**: "Use a hash map for O(1) lookups"
- **Sweating person**: "Programmer trying to optimize code during an interview"
**Caption**: "But the interviewer didn't specify if I need ordered data or not! #InterviewAnxiety"

## 7. "The Self-Balancing Tree Advantage"
**Format**: "How it started vs. How it's going" meme
- **How it started**: Horribly unbalanced BST with a height of n
- **How it's going**: Perfectly balanced AVL tree with a height of log n
**Caption**: "The glowup after implementing rotations. #BalanceIsKey #StayTuned"

## 8. "The Recursive BST Operations"
**Format**: Inception movie meme (dream within a dream)
- **Image**: Nested layers representing recursive calls
- **Text overlay**: "me debugging a recursive BST deletion function that calls itself 5 levels deep"
**Caption**: "I need to go deeper to find the inorder successor. #RecursionMadness"

## 9. "The Range Query Specialist"
**Format**: "Is this a pigeon?" meme
- **Person**: "Me with my new BST knowledge"
- **Butterfly**: "Any problem involving ranges or sorted data"
- **Text**: "Is this a BST application?"
**Caption**: "Once you understand BSTs, you see them everywhere. #DataStructureVision"

## 10. "The BST vs. Hash Table Tradeoff"
**Format**: Buff Doge vs. Cheems meme
- **Buff Doge (BST)**: "Can efficiently find predecessors, successors, and range queries. Maintains sorted order. Guaranteed O(log n) worst-case for balanced variants."
- **Cheems (Hash Table)**: "Can only find exact matches. No ordering. O(n) worst-case performance."
**Caption**: "Choose your data structure wisely. Sometimes the extra log factor is worth it. #AlgorithmTradeoffs"

## 11. "The Binary Search Tree Deletion Cases"
**Format**: "Increasingly complicated brain" meme (3 panels)
- **Panel 1 (simplest brain)**: "Deleting a leaf node: Just remove it"
- **Panel 2 (more complex brain)**: "Deleting a node with one child: Replace with its child"
- **Panel 3 (galaxy brain)**: "Deleting a node with two children: Find inorder successor, copy its value, then delete the successor"
**Caption**: "BST deletion complexity tier list. #CaseThreeIsTricky"

## 12. "The Database Index Reality"
**Format**: "What my friends think I do / What I actually do" multi-panel meme
- **What people think indexing is**: Simple sorted list
- **What my professor thinks it is**: Perfect binary search tree
- **What my textbook shows**: B+ tree with complex rules

## Neon Color Scheme for All Memes
- Background: Dark (#121212)
- Text highlights and borders: 
  - Cyan (#00FFFF) for search operations
  - Pink (#FF00FF) for insert operations
  - Yellow (#FFFF00) for delete operations
  - Green (#00FF00) for traversal operations
- Use gradient effects between these colors for visual appeal
- Keep clean, non-overlapping layout with text clearly visible against dark background
