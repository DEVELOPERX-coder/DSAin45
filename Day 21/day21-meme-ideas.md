## Neon Color Scheme for All Memes
- Background: Dark (#121212)
- Text highlights and borders: 
  - Cyan (#00FFFF) for searching algorithms
  - Pink (#FF00FF) for sorting algorithms
  - Yellow (#FFFF00) for divide and conquer
  - Green (#00FF00) for two-pointer technique
- Use gradient effects between these colors for visual appeal
- Keep clean, non-overlapping layout with text clearly visible against dark background
