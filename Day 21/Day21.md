# üîç DAY 21: Week 3 Challenge & Recap - Mastering Basic Algorithms #DSAin45

Welcome to Day 21 of our 45-day DSA journey! We've completed an exciting week diving into fundamental algorithms, and it's time to consolidate our knowledge. This recap will help reinforce what we've learned, address common misconceptions, and prepare us for the upcoming week on trees.

## üß† Connecting the Dots: Algorithm Relationships

Understanding how these algorithms relate to each other is essential for developing algorithmic intuition:

1. **Recursion as a Foundation**

   - Recursive thinking appears in binary search, merge sort, quick sort, and divide and conquer
   - Mastering recursion is the gateway to understanding more complex algorithms

2. **Search & Sort Connection**

   - Binary search requires sorted data
   - The efficiency of your searching algorithm depends on whether your data is sorted
   - The right sorting algorithm can dramatically improve search performance

3. **Divide & Conquer and Sorting**

   - Merge sort and quick sort are prime examples of divide and conquer
   - Breaking down a large sorting problem into smaller, more manageable pieces

4. **Two Pointers and Search/Sort**
   - Binary search is essentially a two-pointer technique on sorted data
   - The partition step in quick sort uses a two-pointer approach
   - Many optimized algorithms combine sorting with two-pointer techniques

## üîÑ Algorithm Selection Framework

1. **Problem Analysis**

   - What type of data structure are you working with?
   - What's the current state of the data? (sorted, unsorted, partially sorted)
   - What's the size of the input?
   - What operation needs to be performed? (search, sort, transform)

2. **Constraint Evaluation**

   - Time complexity requirements
   - Space complexity constraints
   - In-place modification needed?
   - Stability requirements

3. **Algorithm Selection**

   - For searching in unsorted data ‚Üí Linear search
   - For searching in sorted data ‚Üí Binary search
   - For sorting small arrays or nearly sorted data ‚Üí Insertion sort
   - For sorting with O(n log n) guarantee ‚Üí Merge sort
   - For in-place sorting with good average case ‚Üí Quick sort
   - For problems that can be broken down ‚Üí Divide and conquer
   - For problems with paired elements or subarrays ‚Üí Two-pointer technique

4. **Implementation Considerations**
   - Recursive vs. iterative implementation
   - Edge cases handling
   - Optimization opportunities

## üèÜ Integrated Challenge Problems

Let's tackle problems that combine multiple algorithmic techniques we've learned this week:

### Challenge 1: K Closest Points to Origin

**Problem Statement:** Given an array of points in the 2D plane and an integer k, find the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

**Input:** Array of points `[[x1,y1], [x2,y2], ...]` and integer k
**Output:** The k closest points to the origin

**Example:**

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: The distance from (-2, 2) to the origin is sqrt(8), which is smaller than the distance from (1, 3) to the origin, which is sqrt(10).
```

**Solution Approach:**
This problem combines:

- Quick sort partitioning logic (for efficient selection)
- Divide and conquer (for reducing the problem size)
- Mathematical distance calculation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
        // Quick select approach
        int left = 0, right = points.size() - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int pivotIndex = partition(points, left, right);

            if (pivotIndex == k - 1) {
                break;
            } else if (pivotIndex < k - 1) {
                left = pivotIndex + 1;
            } else {
                right = pivotIndex - 1;
            }
        }

        return vector<vector<int>>(points.begin(), points.begin() + k);
    }

private:
    // Compute squared Euclidean distance
    int squaredDistance(const vector<int>& point) {
        return point[0] * point[0] + point[1] * point[1];
    }

    int partition(vector<vector<int>>& points, int left, int right) {
        // Choose a pivot (median of three would be better in practice)
        int pivotIndex = left + rand() % (right - left + 1);
        int pivotDist = squaredDistance(points[pivotIndex]);

        // Move pivot to the end
        swap(points[pivotIndex], points[right]);

        // Partition around the pivot distance
        int storeIndex = left;
        for (int i = left; i < right; i++) {
            if (squaredDistance(points[i]) < pivotDist) {
                swap(points[i], points[storeIndex]);
                storeIndex++;
            }
        }

        // Move pivot to its final place
        swap(points[storeIndex], points[right]);
        return storeIndex;
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) on average, where n is the number of points
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for in-place partitioning

**Discussion:**

- This solution uses the quick select algorithm, which is related to quick sort
- It leverages divide and conquer by reducing the search space by approximately half in each recursive step
- We could also solve this using a heap or a full sort, but quick select is more efficient
- The key insight is that we don't need to fully sort the array, just partition it until we find the kth element

### Challenge 2: Merge Intervals

**Problem Statement:** Given an array of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Input:** Array of intervals `[[start1,end1], [start2,end2], ...]`
**Output:** Merged intervals

**Example:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, we merge them into [1,6].
```

**Solution Approach:**
This problem combines:

- Sorting (to arrange intervals by start time)
- Two-pointer technique (merging adjacent intervals)

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        if (intervals.empty()) {
            return {};
        }

        // Sort intervals by start time
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(),
             [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b) {
                 return a[0] < b[0];
             });

        vector<vector<int>> merged;
        merged.push_back(intervals[0]);

        // Two-pointer approach (current and result)
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            // Get reference to the last interval in our result
            vector<int>& last = merged.back();

            // If current interval overlaps with the last merged interval
            if (intervals[i][0] <= last[1]) {
                // Update the end time of the last interval if needed
                last[1] = max(last[1], intervals[i][1]);
            } else {
                // Add the current interval to the result
                merged.push_back(intervals[i]);
            }
        }

        return merged;
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to sorting
**Space Complexity:** O(1) excluding the output array

**Discussion:**

- Sorting helps us ensure that overlapping intervals are adjacent
- The two-pointer technique (one for the current interval, one for the last merged interval) efficiently combines intervals
- This is a greedy approach that works because we process intervals in order of their start times
- The key insight is that sorting transforms the problem into a linear traversal

### Challenge 3: Longest Increasing Subsequence

**Problem Statement:** Given an integer array, find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

**Input:** Integer array `nums`
**Output:** Length of the longest increasing subsequence

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], which has length 4.
```

**Solution Approach 1: Dynamic Programming**

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // dp[i] = length of LIS ending at index i
        vector<int> dp(n, 1);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤)
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

**Solution Approach 2: Binary Search**

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;

        // tails[i] = smallest value that ends an increasing subsequence of length i+1
        vector<int> tails;

        for (int num : nums) {
            // Find the position where num should be placed
            auto it = lower_bound(tails.begin(), tails.end(), num);

            if (it == tails.end()) {
                // num is larger than all elements in tails
                tails.push_back(num);
            } else {
                // Replace the smallest value that is >= num
                *it = num;
            }
        }

        return tails.size();
    }
};
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

**Discussion:**

- The DP solution uses a classic approach where dp[i] represents the length of the LIS ending at index i
- The binary search solution is more efficient and uses a clever technique:
  - The array `tails` is not the LIS itself, but represents the smallest ending value of all increasing subsequences of length i
  - Binary search (lower_bound) is used to find the correct position for each element
  - This approach combines binary search and greedy techniques
- The key insight is that we can reduce time complexity by only tracking the smallest ending values

## üîÑ Recursive to Iterative Transformations

One important skill is converting between recursive and iterative implementations. Let's see how this works with binary search:

### Recursive Binary Search

```cpp
int binarySearchRecursive(vector<int>& nums, int target, int left, int right) {
    if (left > right) {
        return -1; // Target not found
    }

    int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

    if (nums[mid] == target) {
        return mid;
    } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
        return binarySearchRecursive(nums, target, left, mid - 1);
    } else {
        return binarySearchRecursive(nums, target, mid + 1, right);
    }
}
```

### Iterative Binary Search

```cpp
int binarySearchIterative(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = nums.size() - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if (nums[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return -1; // Target not found
}
```

### Transformation Process:

1. **Identify the base case(s)** in the recursive solution

   - In binary search: `if (left > right) return -1;`
   - This becomes the loop termination condition: `while (left <= right)`

2. **Identify the recursive calls**

   - These become updates to the loop variables

3. **Replace the call stack with explicit data structures if needed**

   - For more complex algorithms, you might need a stack or queue to simulate the call stack
   - Binary search is simple enough that loop variables suffice

4. **Ensure the same state transitions**
   - Make sure the iterative version handles the same state changes and edge cases

## üîé Performance Optimization Case Studies

Let's examine real-world examples of algorithm optimization:

### Case Study 1: Sort vs. Count Array

**Problem:** Count the frequency of elements in an array.

**Approach 1: Sort and Count**

```cpp
vector<pair<int, int>> countFrequency(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Sort the array
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());

    vector<pair<int, int>> result;

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        int count = 1;
        while (i + 1 < nums.size() && nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
            count++;
            i++;
        }
        result.push_back({nums[i], count});
    }

    return result;
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to sorting

**Approach 2: Hash Map**

```cpp
vector<pair<int, int>> countFrequency(vector<int>& nums) {
    unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;

    // Count frequencies
    for (int num : nums) {
        freqMap[num]++;
    }

    // Convert map to result format
    vector<pair<int, int>> result;
    for (auto& [num, count] : freqMap) {
        result.push_back({num, count});
    }

    return result;
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Optimization Analysis:**

- The sorting approach is intuitive but takes O(n log n) time
- The hash map approach is O(n) and works better for large arrays
- However, sorting might be faster for small arrays due to the constant factors and cache efficiency
- If elements are in a bounded range, we could use an array instead of a hash map for even better performance

### Case Study 2: Finding Two Numbers with a Given Sum

**Problem:** Find two numbers in an array that sum to a target.

**Approach 1: Brute Force**

```cpp
vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                return {i, j};
            }
        }
    }
    return {};
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤)

**Approach 2: Hash Map**

```cpp
vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    unordered_map<int, int> numMap;

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        int complement = target - nums[i];

        if (numMap.find(complement) != numMap.end()) {
            return {numMap[complement], i};
        }

        numMap[nums[i]] = i;
    }

    return {};
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Approach 3: Two-Pointer (for sorted arrays)**

```cpp
vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    // Note: This returns values, not indices, and assumes sorted input
    int left = 0;
    int right = nums.size() - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];

        if (sum == target) {
            return {nums[left], nums[right]};
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    return {};
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) if already sorted, O(n log n) if sorting needed

**Optimization Analysis:**

- The hash map approach is generally the most efficient for unsorted arrays
- The two-pointer approach is best for sorted arrays
- The choice between them depends on whether the array is sorted and whether we need indices or values

3. **The Sorting Competition**
   "A bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort walk into a bar to settle once and for all which is faster. The bubble sort orders a beer with O(n¬≤) excitement, the merge sort divides its drink in half before consuming, and the quick sort keeps picking random pivoting stools until it's kicked out."

4. **The Two-Pointer Relationship**
